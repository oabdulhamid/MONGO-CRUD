## Description

This is a Todo List app that helps to make a list of tasks such as daily routing or any thing we intend doing that require us to do then in a sequencial order. 

- I'm motivated to do this because it's a great tool for every one.
- I built it to relieve us of keeping a physical note which might  cause a delay incase we lost or forgot it somewhere.
